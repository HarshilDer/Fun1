# 🥦 Grocify Pro V3: The Ultimate Expense Architect

**Grocify Pro V3** is a high-performance, service-oriented web application designed to take the stress out of shared living and group grocery shopping. Built with a modular "Linear Function" architecture, it doesn't just calculate totals—it engineers the most efficient way to settle debts.

## 🚀 Pro V3 Feature Suite

### 🧠 Intelligence & Math

* **Debt Simplification Engine:** Uses a greedy optimization algorithm to minimize the number of transactions. Instead of complex group balances, it tells you exactly who needs to pay whom (e.g., *"Abhi pays Harshil $15"*).
* **Specific Split Logic:** Unlike basic calculators, Grocify allows you to split an item between specific members of the group while ignoring others.
* **Payer vs. Debtor Tracking:** Distinguishes between the person who swiped the card and the people who consumed the goods.

### 📊 Data & Visuals

* **Grouped Bar Visualization:** Real-time Plotly charts that categorize spending (Veg, Dairy, Meat, etc.) and color-code them by the payer.
* **Dynamic Search & Filter:** Instantly filter months of history by item name, person, or category using the high-speed search bar.
* **Multi-Currency Support:** Global-ready with a one-click toggle between **$, ₹, €, and £**.

### 🛠 Architecture (The "Linear" Shift)

* **Service-Oriented Design:** The backend is decoupled into independent units:
* **Data Unit:** Modern SQLAlchemy 2.0 database management.
* **Math Unit:** Pure logic for balance and settlement calculations.
* **Visual Unit:** Dynamic chart generation.


* **API-Driven Modals:** Edit windows fetch data asynchronously to ensure 100% data integrity and zero "expectation errors."

### 🎨 User Experience & Effects

* **Tri-Mode UI:** * **Light:** Clean and professional.
* **Dark:** High-contrast for night use.
* **Vibrant Funky:** A Cyberpunk Neon aesthetic with magenta glows and electric lime accents.


* **One-Click Share:** Built-in screenshot tool (`html2canvas`) to capture your settlement card as an image for WhatsApp or Slack.
* **Safety First:** A "Settle Up" confirmation system to prevent accidental data wipes.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Python 3.13, Flask
* **Database:** SQLAlchemy 2.0 (SQLite)

## 📸 How It Works

1. **Add Members:** Populate your household or group.
2. **Log Expenses:** Input the item, price, who paid, and exactly who is sharing it.
3. **Analyze:** View the Grouped Bar Chart to see where the money is going.
4. **Settle:** Use the "Who Pays Whom" list to square up and click "Settle Up" to start fresh for the next month.
